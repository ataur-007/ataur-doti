            <P>Online education can have a real impact in the developing world. Last week,
                we needed to hire a programmer for a small freelance job. To my surprise,
                several candidates advertised they had completed programming MOOCs.
                These were young programmers in their 20’s, in countries like Pakistan and Thailand,
                who lacked college-level coursework, </P>
